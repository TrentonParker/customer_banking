## module 3 challenge

**This is my repository for the Module 3 Challenge, *"customer_banking"*. You will be prompted to enter your savings account balance, the interest rate for it, and the number of months that you want to factor in. It will then return the interest earned on the account as well as the total savings account balance for the amount of months that you entered. You will then be prompted the same questions (and get the same returns) for your CD account!** 

*All in all I felt like this challenge was a bit easier than the Module 2 Challenge, so it was definitely a confidence booster. I'm excited to continue to learn more!* ðŸ˜›
